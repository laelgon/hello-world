# hello-world
This is a repository. Repositories are used to organize a project. Repositories can have folders, images, videos, and data sets (anything the project needs).

So I'm Lacy and I have a very enthusiastic computer programming husband. He believes that programming is made of rainbows and butterflies and that I will believe it too once I learn to program. Therefore, I have decided that I also like rainbows and butterflies and would like to experience them on a daily bases. 


Run run run...Run Run away!!!
